<h2>We have a minor issueâ€¦</h2>

<p>You entered your teacher's email address as <em>teacher_email</em>.</p>

<p>If this is correct, the issue may be that your teacher hasn't created an account yet. If that's the case, refresh this page after he or she creates one.</p>

<p>If you made a typo or entered the wrong email address, you can change it here.</p>

<%= form_for @student do |f| %>
  <%= f.label :teacher_email, 'Your Teacher\'s Email Address' %>:
  <%= f.text_field :teacher_email, class: 'form-control' %><br />

  <%= submit_tag 'Update', class: 'btn btn-primary' %>
<% end %>
